                                Intro


->  eg -:
        •  Voice assistants like siri, alexa and google assistant set an alarm or play a song, the system processes your voice, understands the command, 
           and responds accordingly. That’s cognitive computing!
        •  Instagram/Facebook Feeds : Cognitive systems analyze your preferences, time spent on posts, and interactions to personalize your feed.


->  Definations :-
        •  Subset of AI.
        •  Cognitive computing is one such technology that can evaluate an individual's performance and offer personalized recommendations.
        •  Pertaining to the processes of thinking,reasoning,understanding,learning and problem-solving(intellectual activities)
        •  Cognitive computing is a technology that mimics human thought processes using artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML),
           natural language processing (NLP), and data analytics.
        •  Cognitive processes use existing knowledge and generate new knowledge and it continuously acquires knowledge from the existing to 
           understand human interaction and provide answers.
        •  Focuses on building systems that augment human intelligence, helping humans make better decisions.
        •  A cognitive system is probabilistic.


->  Examples of cognition include:
        •  paying attention to something in the environment,
        •  learning something new,
        •  making decisions,
        •  processing language,
        •  sensing and perceiving environmental stimuli,
        •  solving problems, and
        •  using memory.


->  These advanced systems do more than execute commands :-
        •  Grasps your need
        •  Anticipate your questions
        •  Proactively deliver valuable insights


->  eg. For instance, the cognitive computing system can help a bank detect fraudulent transactions, or it can be employed by a company to 
        improve its customer support through the chat bot.


->  Difference b/w AI & CC :-
        AI : •  Builds systems that replace the human intelligence for automating tasks and decision making.
             •  Works autonomously to solve problems.

             •  eg. IBM watson,Healthcare diagnosis system etc.


->  Human understanding & CC :-
        •  Humans go through 4 step while understanding something and making a decision :-
            (1)  Observe visible phenomenon and bodies of evidence.
            (2)  Visualise and create hypothesis(all possible solutions).
            (3)  Check if hypothesis is right or wrong.
            (4)  Decide choosing the option that is best and act accordingly.
        •  Cognitive systems use similar processes to reason about the information they read, and they can do this at massive speed and scale.

->  **  Structured Data :
        (1)  Data that can be processed,stored and retieved in a fixed format
        (2)  Refers to  highly organised info. that can be readily & seamlessly stored & accessed from a database by simple search engine algos
        (3)  eg. Bank transactions

    **  Unstructured data :
        (1)  Refers to the data that lack any specific form or structure whatsoever.
        (2)  This makes it very difficult and time-consuming to analyze unstructured data.
        (3)  Stored in data lakes, NoSQL (Not Only Structured Query Language) databases, or cloud-based systems.
        (4)  Free-form or undefined format (e.g., text, images, videos, audio).
        (5)  eg. Social media posts

    **  Semi-structured data :
        (1)  Refers to the data containing both the formats i.e. structured and unstructured data.
        (2)  Refers to the data that although has not been classified under a particular repository (database), yet contains vital information or 
             tags that segregate individual elements within the data.
        (3)  eg. email as :  The written content of an email is unstructured, whereas there are some inherent structure to the info. in 
             each email, such as the sender’s name, recipient address, recipient name and date sent.


->  Big data :
        •  Refers to the dynamic,large and disparate volumes of data being created by people,tools and machines.

        •  Generte hypothesis :  Proposing and testing possible solutions


->  Regression :
        •  ML technique that determines the relationship b/w variables(having independent and dependent variable(s)).
        •  Relation can be linear or non-linear(like quadratic,cubic).
        •  Determine the strength and character of the relationship between one dependent variable(usually denoted by Y) and a series of other 
           variables(known as independent variables).
                        ** Strength = Magnitude and Direction(+ve or –ve)

->  Features of Cognitive System :
        • Learn from experience with data/evidence and improve its own knowledge and performance without reprogramming.
        • Generate and/or evaluate conflicting hypotheses based on the current state of its knowledge.
        • Report on findings in a way that justifies conclusions based on confidence in the evidence.
        • Discover patterns in data, with or without explicit guidance from a user regarding the nature of the pattern.
        • Emulate processes or structures found in natural learning systems (that is, memory management, knowledge organization processes, or 
          modeling the neurosynaptic brain structures and processes).
        • Use NLP to extract meaning from textual data and use deep learning tools to extract features from images, video, voice, and sensors.
        • Use a variety of predictive analytics algorithms and statistical techniques.


->  Difference b/w Probabilistic & Deterministic :-
        •  Probabilistic :
                *  In a probabilistic system, there may be a variety of answers, depending on circumstances or context and the confidence 
                   level or probability based on the system’s current knowledge.
                *  Exact output is unknown
                *  E.g. weather forecasting,mail delivery etc.

        •  Deterministic :
                *  A deterministic system would have to return a single answer based on the evidence, or no answer if there were a condition of uncertainty.
                *  Output is certain
                *  Relationships between inputs are known and certain
                *  E.g. Traditional form submissions, calculators, Algorithmic systems etc.
