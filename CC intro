                                Intro


->  eg -:
        •  Voice assistants like siri, alexa and google assistant set an alarm or play a song, the system processes your voice, understands the command, 
           and responds accordingly. That’s cognitive computing!
        •  Instagram/Facebook Feeds : Cognitive systems analyze your preferences, time spent on posts, and interactions to personalize your feed.


->  Definations :-
        •  Subset of AI.
        •  Cognitive computing is one such technology that can evaluate an individual's performance and offer personalized recommendations.
        •  Pertaining to the processes of thinking,reasoning,understanding,learning and problem-solving(intellectual activities)
        •  Cognitive computing is a technology that mimics human thought processes using artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML),
           natural language processing (NLP), and data analytics.
        •  Cognitive processes use existing knowledge and generate new knowledge and it continuously acquires knowledge from the existing to 
           understand human interaction and provide answers.
        •  Focuses on building systems that augment human intelligence, helping humans make better decisions.
        •  A cognitive system is probabilistic.


->  Examples of cognition include:
        •  paying attention to something in the environment,
        •  learning something new,
        •  making decisions,
        •  processing language,
        •  sensing and perceiving environmental stimuli,
        •  solving problems, and
        •  using memory.


->  These advanced systems do more than execute commands :-
        •  Grasps your need
        •  Anticipate your questions
        •  Proactively deliver valuable insights


->  eg. For instance, the cognitive computing system can help a bank detect fraudulent transactions, or it can be employed by a company to 
        improve its customer support through the chat bot.


->  Difference b/w AI & CC :-
        AI : •  Builds systems that replace the human intelligence for automating tasks and decision making.
             •  Works autonomously to solve problems.
             •  eg. ChatGPT, self-driving cars, Robotic Process Automation, Optimisation algorithms etc.
        CC : •  Builds systems that augment the human intelligence for helping humans make better decision making.
             •  Colaborates with human to assist in problem solving.
             •  eg. IBM watson,Healthcare diagnosis system etc.


->  Human understanding & CC :-
        •  Humans go through 4 step while understanding something and making a decision :-
            (1)  Observe visible phenomenon and bodies of evidence.
            (2)  Visualise and create hypothesis(all possible solutions).
            (3)  Check if hypothesis is right or wrong.
            (4)  Decide choosing the option that is best and act accordingly.
        •  Cognitive systems use similar processes to reason about the information they read, and they can do this at massive speed and scale.


->  Core elements of CC :
        •  Perception => Basis of CC to interpret & understand the environment.It's components include sensing,where data , whether structured 
                         or unstructured.
        •  Learning => CC Employs ML To analyze data & extract meaningful info. from the data.
        •  Reasoning => Making accurate predictions and decisions based on data analysis.


->  Benefits of CC :
        •  Elevated decision making => Due to the analysis of huge datasets.
        •  Improves efficiency => As a lot of time and resources are saved by automating tasks.
        •  Enables interactive communication => With the help of Natural Language Processing.


->  Companies using CC :  
        •  IBM
        •  Google
        •  Amazon
        •  JPMorgan Chase
        •  Wells Fargo


->  Goals :
        •  Develop systems that can understand, interpret, and respond to complex information like the way humans do.

                                      *  Breaking down text into smaller,manageable units called tokens.
                                      *  eg. Word tokenization = input : "Hello sir , hi!"
                                                                 output : ["Hello","sir",",","hi","!"]
                                             Sentence tokenization = input : "Hello! How are you? I am fine."
                                                                     output : ["Hello!","How are you?","I am fine."]

                                      *  eg. Sentence : "The cat sits on the mat." 
                                             Subject : "The cat"
                                             Verb : "sits"
                                             Prepositional phrase : "on the mat"
                        (3)  Sentiment analysis :
                                      *  Also known as opinion mining,used to determine the sentiment or emotion expressed in a peice of text.
        •  Applications :  Chatbots,Language translation, smart assistants like siri,alexa etc.
        •  Uses in CC :  It allows cognitive systems to interpret human language in all its complexity, enabling machines to understand spoken
           or written text much like a human listener or reader would.

           data, extracting meaningful insights to support reasoning, learning, and decision-making processes.


->  **  Structured Data :
        (1)  Data that can be processed,stored and retieved in a fixed format
        (2)  Refers to  highly organised info. that can be readily & seamlessly stored & accessed from a database by simple search engine algos
        (3)  eg. Bank transactions

    **  Unstructured data :
        (1)  Refers to the data that lack any specific form or structure whatsoever.
        (2)  This makes it very difficult and time-consuming to analyze unstructured data.
        (3)  Stored in data lakes, NoSQL (Not Only Structured Query Language) databases, or cloud-based systems.
        (4)  Free-form or undefined format (e.g., text, images, videos, audio).
        (5)  eg. Social media posts

    **  Semi-structured data :
        (1)  Refers to the data containing both the formats i.e. structured and unstructured data.
        (2)  Refers to the data that although has not been classified under a particular repository (database), yet contains vital information or 
             tags that segregate individual elements within the data.
        (3)  eg. email as :  The written content of an email is unstructured, whereas there are some inherent structure to the info. in 
             each email, such as the sender’s name, recipient address, recipient name and date sent.


->  Big data :
        •  Refers to the dynamic,large and disparate volumes of data being created by people,tools and machines.
        •  Characteristics of big data : (5 V's)
                                    *  Velocity :  Speed at which data is being created in real time.
                                    *  Volume :  The scale of the data or the increase in the amount of data stored.
                                    *  Variety :  The diversity of the data.
                                    *  Veracity :  The quality and origin of data and its conformity to facts and accuracy.
                                                   Attributes include consistency, completeness, integrity, and ambiguity
